############   Short summary   ##################
# <type>[optional scope]: <description>
# The allowed {types} are as follows:
# chore -> maintenance
# docs -> documentation
# feat -> feature
# fix -> bug fix
# drop -> remove code
# style -> formatting/style changes
# refactor -> refactoring code
# test -> adding missing tests


##################   Body   ###########################################
# [optional body]


##########################    Footer    ###############################

# [optional footer(s)]

# The {scope} can be anything specifying place of the commit change.
# The {subject} needs to use imperative, present tense: “change”, not “changed” nor “changes”. The first letter should not be capitalized, and there is no dot (.) at the end.
# Just like the {subject}, the message {body} needs to be in the present tense, and includes the motivation for the change, as well as a contrast with the previous behaviour. The first letter in a paragraph must be capitalised.
# All breaking changes need to be mentioned in the {footer} with the description of the change, the justification behind the change and any migration notes required.
